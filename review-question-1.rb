# How would you get the url for Bulbasaur's ability?
url = pokemon.find {|poke| poke[:name] ==
"bulbasaur"}[:abilities][0][:ability][:url]
# How would you return the first pokemon with base experience over 40?
wise = pokemon.find {|poke| poke[:base_experience] > 40}
# How would you return ALL OF THE pokemon with base experience over 40? (Gotta catch em all)
wise_guys = pokemon.select {|poke| poke[:base_experience] > 40}
# How would you return an array of all of the pokemon's names?
names = pokemon.map {|poke| poke[:name]}
# How would you determine whether or not the pokemon array contained any pokemon with a weight greater than 60?
#  whatever method you use should return true if there are any such pokemon, false if not.
heavies = pokemon.any? {|poke| poke[:weight] > 60}
